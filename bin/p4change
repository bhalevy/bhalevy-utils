# This way reports the top change, even if it only deletes files.  But,
# it does not limit itself to what's in your sandbox.  It shows all the
# changes that touch your sandbox view, regardless of what's in your
# sandbox.

# This way does not report the top change if it only deletes files.
# However, it does restrict itself to what's actually in in your
