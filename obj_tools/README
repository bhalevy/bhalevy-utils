* pan_obsd_util_read_obj: reads all components using pan_obsd_util_read

* xor_files, xor_many: used to xor all the object's components together to
compute the error vector.

* get_obj: is the high level util to get an object's attrs, data, and compute
and hexdump the error vector.

* obj_data: can read data from the saved components given an offset and
length (supports raid-5 only)  I usually use it only to translate virtual
<offset, length> to components <offset, length>  using the -n option (and -x to
print offsets and lengths in hex)

* grdata: greps hexdump for the given pattern.  I use it to print the same
offsets from all components.

* scp_obj_tools scp's all the tools above to where you tell it.
(won't be needed once the tools are installed on blades)
