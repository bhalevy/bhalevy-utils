clantlr parses antlr gammer source files and print a
"canonicalized" version that leaves out target languange specifics
for easier comparison of different implementations.
For example, comparing the scylladb and cassandra implementations of cql.

Usage:
$ clantlr <(clantlr_prep < Example.g) > Example-clantlr.g
