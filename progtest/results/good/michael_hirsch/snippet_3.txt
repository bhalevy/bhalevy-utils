3.  Pointer manipulation: the loop increment statement is wrong since *i is a synonym for pending_list.  This means that every time the loop executes, an element is lost from the head of the  pending_list.

packet **i = &pending_list;

for (;(*i) != NULL && ((*i) != p); *i = ((*i)->next)) {
/* do nothing */;
}
