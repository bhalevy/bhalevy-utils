Solution to test questions are found in the following files:
=============================================================

snippet_2.c - problem 2 with annotations explaining the problems/solutions in the code
snippet_2_solution.c - clean code solution for problem 2 (RTP packet copy/modify)
snippet_3.c - problem 3 with annotations explaining the problems/solutions in the code
snippet_3_solution.c - clean code solution for problem 3 (linked list item removal)

sg_copy/  - directory holding all files related to problem 1 (scatter-gather maps)
	sg_copy/sg_copy.c - implementation of required function for the sg_copy problem.
	sg_copy/sg_copy.h - original header file (with minor modification - wrapping #ifndef.)
	sg_copy/sg_copy_main.c - test program for quick and dirty testing of sg_copy.
	sg_copy/makefile - makefile for compiling sg_copy solution and tester.
	
Some notes on sg_copy compilation:

The makefile attached will compile the code with a DEBUG flag set.
This is done mainly to bypass the call to malloc and replace it with printf. 
Calling malloc will crash the program as everything is ever so scatterred...
The DEBUG flag will also add debug printing to the sg_destroy() function .

Performing 'make all' will produce an executable named sgtest - that tests the 3 
scatter-gather functions.
