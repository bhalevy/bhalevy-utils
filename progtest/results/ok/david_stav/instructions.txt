1. Please find attached a header file containing definitions
for a scatter-gather data type and a list of functions to implement:

* sg_map maps a memory region into a scatter gather list
* sg_destroy destroys a scatter gather list
* sg_copy copies 'count' bytes from src to dest starting at 'offset'

* ptr_to_phys and phys_to_ptr map a pointer to a physical address and vice-verse
  and are implemented as inline functions.  Please use those to convert virtual
  memory addresses into physical addresses and vice verse.

2. Find all possible mistakes (there might be none) in the following
piece of code. The function apparently takes an RTP packet, and
creates a new RTP packet with all the fields same as the previous RTP
packet except that the sequence number and timestamp are changed.

<see attached snippet_2.c>

3. Pointer manipulation: The following function is suppose to delete
an element from a singly linked list. Will it work? If yes, show the
steps when the linked list has initially 4 elements and the last
element is supposed to be deleted. If not, point out a mistake.

<see attached snippet_3.c>
