The function in snippet_3.c will not work.

1. In line 7, we get a pointer to the head of the list (which is
a pointer to packet). When we do "*i = ((*i)->next)" in line 9, we actually
change the head of the global list. This is probably not what we intended to do!
We need to hold an iterator which is packet* and not packet**.

2. We need to keep a pointer to the element before the one we want to delete.
We need to set its next pointer to be the one after the element we intend to
remove.

3. We must take special care in case the element we want to delete is the head
of the list. In that case, the head of the global list must be changed as well
(since the list has a new head now)
